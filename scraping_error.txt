Tried the https://www.racing.com html,
 but surprisingly it has a different html code for my browser and the python crawler.
 Probably because of the javascript attached. and Now I'm clueless as its a dynamic webpage.
 Unsure how to scrape it as when I compare the HTML for the same link opened by the browser and via python,
 the content differs probably because of a lack of application of the js embedded along with

Now for the other website,  https://www.racenet.com.au/horse-racing-results
I have an option to select the date in the search bar to fetch me a race but I'm unsure on how to embed that in the python crawler link 
as the browser link stays the same regardless of what date I search. Probably there is a usage of some ajax / dynamic js where it doesn't
hyperlink for everyt search entry. So what we did for greyhound isn't possible. Over there, I could traverse each date, find a list of races
and then for each race I would open the link and fetch the data and add it to the data frame. that seems hard over here as I don't 
have aggregate data on the race names and venues + dates

this one requires a sign-in so I'm unsure how to go about it. On reading a little more about it, it seems that I need some advanceed membership 
for the access

the problem with this one is that it has data only upto the month before. So again, I'm clueless on how to proceed
